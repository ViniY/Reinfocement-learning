Hi, 

This project is not related to any work in Vic, just for interesting.

As I am learning RL, openAI seems to be a very good start. So this project will be mainly build using Python with OpenAI packages. And I have no idea what I am gonna do with RL.

Currently, I am just doing some basic tutorials following some famous Youtubter's video. 

Maybe gonna do some interesting later :D ? 
IDK
